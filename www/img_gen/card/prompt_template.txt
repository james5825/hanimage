Make a colorful learning poster that shows the history of the Chinese word """CHINESE_CHARACTER""" (it means """CHARACTER_MEANING_ENGLISH""").

1. On the left side:
- Draw the word changing over time from old writing to new writing.

2. On the right side:
- Draw """CREATURE_DESCRIPTION""". 
- It should match the meaning of the word and look really cool or magical.

3. Style:
- Use """ART_STYLE""" (like anime, cartoon, fantasy).
- Add an old-paper background with pretty borders.
- Put the title at the top: “How the word ‘"""CHARACTER_MEANING_ENGLISH"""’ Changed”
- Show the final word again at the bottom in a special box.


--------
"""CHINESE_CHARACTER""" – The Chinese word we are showing (like 龍, 馬, 牛, etc.)

"""CHARACTER_MEANING_ENGLISH""" – What the word means in English (like Dragon, Horse, Ox)

"""EVOLUTION_STEPS""" – How the word looked in old times, in order from oldest to newest (like: bones writing → old style → today's writing)

"""CREATURE_DESCRIPTION""" – What kind of animal or magical creature we want to draw (like: a shiny dragon with fire hair, or a strong turtle with armor)

"""ART_STYLE""" – The style of the drawing (like: cartoon, storybook, anime, fantasy painting)
